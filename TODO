- Ctrl C, D, \ (in heredoc??)
- check eval sheet cases
- zombie processes
- export valgrind gives error
- cat << EOF1 | grep "pattern" << EOF2 | wc -l -> weird stuff happening

- error messages arent always printed to stderr
- error messages seem to all end with "exit"
- error codes can't be found by the tester

-	when executing file
{
	- Does it exist?
	- Is it a directory?
	- Do we have permission?
}
